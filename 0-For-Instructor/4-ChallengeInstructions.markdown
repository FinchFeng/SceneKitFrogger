# 208: Scene Kit, Part 4: Challenge

Your frogger-clone is starting to shape up. But there is one thing missing before this game is any fun: A challenge.
Your challenge will be to add cars to the roads based on what you have learned so far:
1. Add nodes to the scene for the cars2. Load geometry to make the cars actually look like cars3. Put a material on the car geometry to make the car look nice.4. Make the car move along the road using actions.Once you have finished this challenge, you will have made a bare-bone frogger-clone with all the basic mechanics.
